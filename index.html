      <p>Born on February 14, 2002. Grew up in Al-Khobar, Saudi Arabia as an introverted kid;
        Spoiled brat turned aspiring optimist - only took 18 years to get off her ass and start opening her eyes 
        and see the beauty in grabbing change by its balls and owning it. Now a local Filipino weeb coding and 
        watching anime like a hermit in quarantine, hence all this lol. Questioning bisexual INFP insert-other-
