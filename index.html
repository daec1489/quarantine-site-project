        Born on February 14, 2002. Grew up in Al-Khobar, Saudi Arabia as an
        introverted kid; Spoiled brat turned aspiring optimist - only took 18
        years to get off her ass and start opening her eyes and see the beauty
        in grabbing change by its balls and owning it. Now a local Filipino weeb
        coding and watching anime like a hermit in quarantine, hence all this
        lol. Bisexual, INFP.

      “The family is the test of freedom; because the family is the only thing
      that the free man makes for himself and by himself.” – G.K. Chesterton

    <div class="speech smallText">
      Being a family full of - for a lack of better word - sheltered introverts,
      life isn't always as exciting or adventurous as others' lives, especially
      now with the very precarious situation and circumstances taking over the
      world at this very moment; But nevertheless we're currently trying to do
      our best to support and grow properly into the selves we desperately
      strive to be, which, is quite frankly, a challenge in of itself (think
      <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> (plant with the shortest lifespan) trying to
      become as independent and self-sustaining as cacti. Yup, <i>that</i> much
      of a stretch.) Seems practically impossible - absurd even, considering
      it's extremely difficult to move on from the norm and step out into the
      unknown - even more so when each and every individual (myself included)
      can be very...<i>trying</i> at times; But crying on your ass and staying
      idle like sitting ducks never solved anything - which brings me to the
      main theme of my site here -
      <i>物の哀れ [Mono no aware], the beauty of transience.</i>
    </div>
    <p class="smallText">
      <i>Mono no aware,</i> the Japanese love for impermanence, is literally
      what it means - appreciating the beauty of the feeling of "fleeting";
      everlasting change.

        I aspire to be a bonafide passionate web and game developer. Completely
        enamored with video games and technology ever since I was a kid, I
        decided one day I'd stop repressing my love for them and actually take
        up a career in technology - so here I am! Jumpy college freshman to be,
        trying to practice ahead of school season lol. Í'm also in the process
        of reforming myself - Self-improvement and self-love, full speed ahead!
        I can't adopt to an ever-changing world if I don't try to dare to match
        its pace, after all. I also hope to visit Japan one day!
